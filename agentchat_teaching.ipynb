      "Summary: This paper explores the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) in\n",
      "strategic game experiments, specifically the ultimatum game and the prisoner's\n",
      "dilemma. I designed prompts and architectures to enable GPT to understand the\n",
      "game rules and to generate both its choices and the reasoning behind decisions.\n",
      "The key findings show that GPT exhibits behaviours similar to human responses,\n",
      "such as making positive offers and rejecting unfair ones in the ultimatum game,\n",
      "along with conditional cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma. The study\n",
      "explores how prompting GPT with traits of fairness concern or selfishness\n",
      "influences its decisions. Notably, the \"fair\" GPT in the ultimatum game tends\n",
      "to make higher offers and reject offers more frequently compared to the\n",
      "\"selfish\" GPT. In the prisoner's dilemma, high cooperation rates are maintained\n",
      "only when both GPT players are \"fair\". The reasoning statements GPT produces\n",
      "during gameplay reveal the underlying logic of certain intriguing patterns\n",

      "Summary: This paper extends the concept of generalized polarization tensors (GPTs),\n",

This paper presents an\\nin-depth measurement study of the GPT Store, with a focus on the categorization\\nof GPTs by topic, factors influencing GPT popularity, and the potential\\nsecurity risks. Our investigation starts with assessing the categorization of\\nGPTs in the GPT Store, analyzing how they are organized by topics, and\\nevaluating the effectiveness of the classification system. We then examine the\\nfactors that affect the popularity of specific GPTs, looking into user\\npreferences, algorithmic influences, and market trends. Finally, the study\\ndelves into the security risks of the GPT Store, identifying potential threats\\nand evaluating the robustness of existing security measures. This study offers\\na detailed overview of the GPT Store\\'s current state, shedding light on its\\noperational dynamics and user interaction patterns. Our findings aim to enhance\\nunderstanding of the GPT ecosystem, providing valuable insights for future\\nresearch, development, and policy-making in generative AI.\\n\\nTitle: GPT in Game Theory Experiments\\nSummary: This paper explores the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) in\\nstrategic game experiments, specifically the ultimatum game and the prisoner\\'s\\ndilemma. I designed prompts and architectures to enable GPT to understand the\\ngame rules and to generate both its choices and the reasoning behind decisions.\\nThe key findings show that GPT exhibits behaviours similar to human responses,\\nsuch as making positive offers and rejecting unfair ones in the ultimatum game,\\nalong with conditional cooperation in the prisoner\\'s dilemma. The study\\nexplores how prompting GPT with traits of fairness concern or selfishness\\ninfluences its decisions. Notably, the \"fair\" GPT in the ultimatum game tends\\nto make higher offers and reject offers more frequently compared to the\\n\"selfish\" GPT. In the prisoner\\'s dilemma, high cooperation rates are maintained\\nonly when both GPT players are \"fair\". The reasoning statements GPT produces\\nduring gameplay reveal the underlying logic of certain intriguing patterns\\nobserved in the games. Overall, this research shows the potential of GPT as a\\nvaluable tool in social science research, especially in experimental studies\\nand social simulations.\\n\\nTitle: An Early Evaluation of GPT-4V(ision)\\nSummary: In this paper, we evaluate different abilities of GPT-4V including visual\\nunderstanding, language understanding, visual puzzle solving, and understanding\\nof other modalities such as depth, thermal, video, and audio. To estimate\\nGPT-4V\\'s performance, we manually construct 656 test instances and carefully\\nevaluate the results of GPT-4V. The highlights of our findings are as follows:\\n(1) GPT-4V exhibits impressive performance on English visual-centric benchmarks\\nbut fails to recognize simple Chinese texts in the images; (2) GPT-4V shows\\ninconsistent refusal behavior when answering questions related to sensitive\\ntraits such as gender, race, and age; (3) GPT-4V obtains worse results than\\nGPT-4 (API) on language understanding tasks including general language\\nunderstanding benchmarks and visual commonsense knowledge evaluation\\nbenchmarks; (4) Few-shot prompting can improve GPT-4V\\'s performance on both\\nvisual understanding and language understanding; (5) GPT-4V struggles to find\\nthe nuances between two similar images and solve the easy math picture puzzles;\\n(6) GPT-4V shows non-trivial performance on the tasks of similar modalities to\\nimage, such as video and thermal. Our experimental results reveal the ability\\nand limitations of GPT-4V and we hope our paper can provide some insights into\\nthe application and research of GPT-4V.\\n\\nTitle: FoundationLayerNorm: Scaling BERT and GPT to 1,000 Layers\\nSummary: The mainstream BERT/GPT model contains only 10 to 20 layers, and there is\\nlittle literature to discuss the training of deep BERT/GPT. This paper proposes\\na simple yet effective method to stabilize BERT and GPT training. We\\nsuccessfully scale up BERT and GPT to 1,000 layers, which is an order of\\nmagnitude deeper than previous BERT and GPT. The proposed method\\nFoundationLayerNormalization enables efficient training of deep neural networks\\nand is validated at the 1000-layer scale.\\n\\nTitle: GPT in Sheep\\'s Clothing: The Risk of Customized GPTs\\nSummary: In November 2023, OpenAI introduced a new service allowing users to create\\ncustom versions of ChatGPT (GPTs) by using specific instructions and knowledge\\nto guide the model\\'s behavior. We aim to raise awareness of the fact that GPTs\\ncan be used maliciously, posing privacy and security risks to their users.\\n\\nTitle: Can GPT-O1 Kill All Bugs? An Evaluation of GPT-Family LLMs on QuixBugs\\nSummary: LLMs have long demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in automatic program\\nrepair (APR), with OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT being one of the most widely used models in\\nthis domain. Through continuous iterations and upgrades of GPT-family models,\\ntheir performance in fixing bugs has already reached state-of-the-art levels.\\nHowever, there are few works comparing the effectiveness and variations of\\ndifferent versions of GPT-family models on APR. In this work, inspired by the\\nrecent public release of the GPT-o1 models, we conduct the first study to\\ncompare the effectiveness of different versions of the GPT-family models in\\nAPR. We evaluate the performance of the latest version of the GPT-family models\\n(i.e., O1-preview and O1-mini), GPT-4o, and the historical version of ChatGPT\\non APR. We conduct an empirical study of the four GPT-family models against\\nother LLMs and APR techniques on the QuixBugs benchmark from multiple\\nevaluation perspectives, including repair success rate, repair cost, response\\nlength, and behavior patterns. The results demonstrate that O1\\'s repair\\ncapability exceeds that of prior GPT-family models, successfully fixing all 40\\nbugs in the benchmark. Our work can serve as a foundation for further in-depth\\nexploration of the applications of GPT-family models in APR.\\n\\nTitle: Reconstruction of Inhomogeneous Conductivities via the Concept of\\n  Generalized Polarization Tensors\\nSummary: This paper extends the concept of generalized polarization tensors (GPTs),\\nwhich was previously defined for inclusions with homogeneous conductivities, to\\ninhomogeneous conductivity inclusions. We begin by giving two slightly\\ndifferent but equivalent definitions of the GPTs for inhomogeneous inclusions.\\nWe then show that, as in the homogeneous case, the GPTs are the basic building\\nblocks for the far-field expansion of the voltage in the presence of the\\nconductivity inclusion. Relating the GPTs to the Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD)\\nmap, it follows that the full knowledge of the GPTs allows unique determination\\nof the conductivity distribution. Furthermore, we show important properties of\\nthe the GPTs, such as symmetry and positivity, and derive bounds satisfied by\\ntheir harmonic sums. We also compute the sensitivity of the GPTs with respect\\nto changes in the conductivity distribution and propose an algorithm for\\nreconstructing conductivity distributions from their GPTs. This provides a new\\nstrategy for solving the highly nonlinear and ill-posed inverse conductivity\\nproblem. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed algorithm by preforming a\\nsensitivity analysis and giving some numerical examples.\\n\\nTitle: Auto-GPT for Online Decision Making: Benchmarks and Additional Opinions\\nSummary: Auto-GPT is an autonomous agent that leverages recent advancements in\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making tasks. While there\\nhas been a growing interest in Auto-GPT stypled agents, questions remain\\nregarding the effectiveness and flexibility of Auto-GPT in solving real-world\\ndecision-making tasks. Its limited capability for real-world engagement and the\\nabsence of benchmarks contribute to these uncertainties. In this paper, we\\npresent a comprehensive benchmark study of Auto-GPT styled agents in\\ndecision-making tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. Our aim is to gain\\ndeeper insights into this problem and understand the adaptability of GPT-based\\nagents. We compare the performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5,\\nClaude, and Vicuna in Auto-GPT styled decision-making tasks. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce the Additional Opinions algorithm, an easy and effective method that\\nincorporates supervised/imitation-based learners into the Auto-GPT scheme. This\\napproach enables lightweight supervised learning without requiring fine-tuning\\nof the foundational LLMs. We demonstrate through careful baseline comparisons\\nand ablation studies that the Additional Opinions algorithm significantly\\nenhances performance in online decision-making benchmarks, including WebShop\\nand ALFWorld.\\n\\nTitle: Large Language Models (GPT) for automating feedback on programming\\n  assignments\\nSummary: Addressing the challenge of generating personalized feedback for programming\\nassignments is demanding due to several factors, like the complexity of code\\nsyntax or different ways to correctly solve a task. In this experimental study,\\nwe automated the process of feedback generation by employing OpenAI\\'s GPT-3.5\\nmodel to generate personalized hints for students solving programming\\nassignments on an automated assessment platform. Students rated the usefulness\\nof GPT-generated hints positively. The experimental group (with GPT hints\\nenabled) relied less on the platform\\'s regular feedback but performed better in\\nterms of percentage of successful submissions across consecutive attempts for\\ntasks, where GPT hints were enabled. For tasks where the GPT feedback was made\\nunavailable, the experimental group needed significantly less time to solve\\nassignments. Furthermore, when GPT hints were unavailable, students in the\\nexperimental condition were initially less likely to solve the assignment\\ncorrectly. This suggests potential over-reliance on GPT-generated feedback.\\nHowever, students in the experimental condition were able to correct reasonably\\nrapidly, reaching the same percentage correct after seven submission attempts.\\nThe availability of GPT hints did not significantly impact students\\' affective\\nstate.\\n\\nTitle: SentimentGPT: Exploiting GPT for Advanced Sentiment Analysis and its\\n  Departure from Current Machine Learning\\nSummary: This study presents a thorough examination of various Generative Pretrained\\nTransformer (GPT) methodologies in sentiment analysis, specifically in the\\ncontext of Task 4 on the SemEval 2017 dataset. Three primary strategies are\\nemployed: 1) prompt engineering using the advanced GPT-3.5 Turbo, 2)\\nfine-tuning GPT models, and 3) an inventive approach to embedding\\nclassification. The research yields detailed comparative insights among these\\nstrategies and individual GPT models, revealing their unique strengths and\\npotential limitations. Additionally, the study compares these GPT-based\\nmethodologies with other current, high-performing models previously used with\\nthe same dataset. The results illustrate the significant superiority of the GPT\\napproaches in terms of predictive performance, more than 22\\\\% in F1-score\\ncompared to the state-of-the-art. Further, the paper sheds light on common\\nchallenges in sentiment analysis tasks, such as understanding context and\\ndetecting sarcasm. It underscores the enhanced capabilities of the GPT models\\nto effectively handle these complexities. Taken together, these findings\\nhighlight the promising potential of GPT models in sentiment analysis, setting\\nthe stage for future research in this field.

This surge in demand\\nposes significant challenges to resource management in clouds. This paper aims\\nto highlight these challenges by first identifying the unique characteristics\\nof resource management for the GPT-based model. Building upon this\\nunderstanding, we analyze the specific challenges faced by resource management\\nin the context of GPT-based model deployed on clouds, and propose corresponding\\npotential solutions. To facilitate effective resource management, we introduce\\na comprehensive resource management framework and present resource scheduling\\nalgorithms specifically designed for the GPT-based model. Furthermore, we delve\\ninto the future directions for resource management in the GPT-based model,\\nhighlighting potential areas for further exploration and improvement. Through\\nthis study, we aim to provide valuable insights into resource management for\\nGPT-based models deployed in clouds and promote their sustainable development\\nfor GPT-based models and applications.\\n\\nTitle: A Study on Zero-shot Non-intrusive Speech Assessment using Large\\n  Language Models\\nSummary: This work investigates two strategies for zero-shot non-intrusive speech\\nassessment leveraging large language models. First, we explore the audio\\nanalysis capabilities of GPT-4o. Second, we propose GPT-Whisper, which uses\\nWhisper as an audio-to-text module and evaluates the naturalness of text via\\ntargeted prompt engineering. We evaluate assessment metrics predicted by GPT-4o\\nand GPT-Whisper examining their correlations with human-based quality and\\nintelligibility assessments, and character error rate (CER) of automatic speech\\nrecognition. Experimental results show that GPT-4o alone is not effective for\\naudio analysis; whereas, GPT-Whisper demonstrates higher prediction, showing\\nmoderate correlation with speech quality and intelligibility, and high\\ncorrelation with CER. Compared to supervised non-intrusive neural speech\\nassessment models, namely MOS-SSL and MTI-Net, GPT-Whisper yields a notably\\nhigher Spearman\\'s rank correlation with the CER of Whisper. These findings\\nvalidate GPT-Whisper as a reliable method for accurate zero-shot speech\\nassessment without requiring additional training data (speech data and\\ncorresponding assessment scores).\\n\\nTitle: Unveiling the Safety of GPT-4o: An Empirical Study using Jailbreak\\n  Attacks\\nSummary: The recent release of GPT-4o has garnered widespread attention due to its\\npowerful general capabilities. While its impressive performance is widely\\nacknowledged, its safety aspects have not been sufficiently explored. Given the\\npotential societal impact of risky content generated by advanced generative AI\\nsuch as GPT-4o, it is crucial to rigorously evaluate its safety. In response to\\nthis question, this paper for the first time conducts a rigorous evaluation of\\nGPT-4o against jailbreak attacks. Specifically, this paper adopts a series of\\nmulti-modal and uni-modal jailbreak attacks on 4 commonly used benchmarks\\nencompassing three modalities (ie, text, speech, and image), which involves the\\noptimization of over 4,000 initial text queries and the analysis and\\nstatistical evaluation of nearly 8,000+ response on GPT-4o. Our extensive\\nexperiments reveal several novel observations: (1) In contrast to the previous\\nversion (such as GPT-4V), GPT-4o has enhanced safety in the context of text\\nmodality jailbreak; (2) The newly introduced audio modality opens up new attack\\nvectors for jailbreak attacks on GPT-4o; (3) Existing black-box multimodal\\njailbreak attack methods are largely ineffective against GPT-4o and GPT-4V.\\nThese findings provide critical insights into the safety implications of GPT-4o\\nand underscore the need for robust alignment guardrails in large models. Our\\ncode is available at \\\\url{https://github.com/NY1024/Jailbreak_GPT4o}.\\n\\nTitle: Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision\\nSummary: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially\\nsubjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters\\nto balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in large\\nfoundation models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in\\nplanning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, a\\nfully automated treatment planning framework that harnesses prior radiation\\noncology knowledge encoded in multi-modal large language models, such as\\nGPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI. GPT-RadPlan is made aware of planning\\nprotocols as context and acts as an expert human planner, capable of guiding a\\ntreatment planning process. Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical\\nprotocols for various disease sites as prompts to enable GPT-4V to acquire\\ntreatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan agent is\\nintegrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an API.\\nThe efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased using multiple\\nprostate and head & neck cancer cases, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to\\nclinical plans. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the\\nclinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and organ-at-risk\\nsparing. Consistently satisfying the dosimetric objectives in the clinical\\nprotocol, GPT-RadPlan represents the first multimodal large language model\\nagent that mimics the behaviors of human planners in radiation oncology\\nclinics, achieving remarkable results in automating the treatment planning\\nprocess without the need for additional training.\\n\\nTitle: Opening A Pandora\\'s Box: Things You Should Know in the Era of Custom\\n  GPTs\\nSummary: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated\\nthe development of a wide range of applications across various fields. There is\\na growing trend in the construction of specialized platforms based on LLMs,\\nsuch as the newly introduced custom GPTs by OpenAI. While custom GPTs provide\\nvarious functionalities like web browsing and code execution, they also\\nintroduce significant security threats. In this paper, we conduct a\\ncomprehensive analysis of the security and privacy issues arising from the\\ncustom GPT platform. Our systematic examination categorizes potential attack\\nscenarios into three threat models based on the role of the malicious actor,\\nand identifies critical data exchange channels in custom GPTs. Utilizing the\\nSTRIDE threat modeling framework, we identify 26 potential attack vectors, with\\n19 being partially or fully validated in real-world settings. Our findings\\nemphasize the urgent need for robust security and privacy measures in the\\ncustom GPT ecosystem, especially in light of the forthcoming launch of the\\nofficial GPT store by OpenAI.\\n\\nTitle: Learning to be Homo Economicus: Can an LLM Learn Preferences from Choice\\nSummary: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision aids,\\nwith a focus on their ability to learn preferences and provide personalized\\nrecommendations. To establish a baseline, we replicate standard economic\\nexperiments on choice under risk (Choi et al., 2007) with GPT, one of the most\\nprominent LLMs, prompted to respond as (i) a human decision maker or (ii) a\\nrecommendation system for customers. With these baselines established, GPT is\\nprovided with a sample set of choices and prompted to make recommendations\\nbased on the provided data. From the data generated by GPT, we identify its\\n(revealed) preferences and explore its ability to learn from data. Our analysis\\nyields three results. First, GPT\\'s choices are consistent with (expected)\\nutility maximization theory. Second, GPT can align its recommendations with\\npeople\\'s risk aversion, by recommending less risky portfolios to more\\nrisk-averse decision makers, highlighting GPT\\'s potential as a personalized\\ndecision aid. Third, however, GPT demonstrates limited alignment when it comes\\nto disappointment aversion.\\n\\nTitle: GPTZoo: A Large-scale Dataset of GPTs for the Research Community\\nSummary: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized\\nnatural language processing, with GPTs, customized versions of ChatGPT\\navailable on the GPT Store, emerging as a prominent technology for specific\\ndomains and tasks. To support academic research on GPTs, we introduce GPTZoo, a\\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 730,420 GPT instances. Each instance includes\\nrich metadata with 21 attributes describing its characteristics, as well as\\ninstructions, knowledge files, and third-party services utilized during its\\ndevelopment. GPTZoo aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive and\\nreadily available resource to study the real-world applications, performance,\\nand potential of GPTs. To facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis of GPTs,\\nwe also developed an automated command-line interface (CLI) that supports\\nkeyword-based searching of the dataset. To promote open research and\\ninnovation, the GPTZoo dataset will undergo continuous updates, and we are\\ngranting researchers public access to GPTZoo and its associated tools.\\n\\nTitle: Accessible fragments of generalized probabilistic theories, cone\\n  equivalence, and applications to witnessing nonclassicality\\nSummary: The formalism of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) was originally\\ndeveloped as a way to characterize the landscape of conceivable physical\\ntheories. Thus, the GPT describing a given physical theory necessarily includes\\nall physically possible processes. We here consider the question of how to\\nprovide a GPT-like characterization of a particular experimental setup within a\\ngiven physical theory. We show that the resulting characterization is not\\ngenerally a GPT in and of itself-rather, it is described by a more general\\nmathematical object that we introduce and term an accessible GPT fragment. We\\nthen introduce an equivalence relation, termed cone equivalence, between\\naccessible GPT fragments (and, as a special case, between standard GPTs). We\\ngive a number of examples of experimental scenarios that are best described\\nusing accessible GPT fragments, and where moreover cone-equivalence arises\\nnaturally. We then prove that an accessible GPT fragment admits of a classical\\nexplanation if and only if every other fragment that is cone-equivalent to it\\nalso admits of a classical explanation. Finally, we leverage this result to\\nprove several fundamental results regarding the experimental requirements for\\nwitnessing the failure of generalized noncontextuality. In particular, we prove\\nthat neither incompatibility among measurements nor the assumption of freedom\\nof choice is necessary for witnessing failures of generalized noncontextuality,\\nand, moreover, that such failures can be witnessed even using arbitrarily\\ninefficient detectors.\\n\\nTitle: How Good Are GPT Models at Machine Translation? A Comprehensive\\n  Evaluation\\nSummary: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have shown remarkable\\ncapabilities for natural language generation, but their performance for machine\\ntranslation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we present a\\ncomprehensive evaluation of GPT models for machine translation, covering\\nvarious aspects such as quality of different GPT models in comparison with\\nstate-of-the-art research and commercial systems, effect of prompting\\nstrategies, robustness towards domain shifts and document-level translation. We\\nexperiment with eighteen different translation directions involving high and\\nlow resource languages, as well as non English-centric translations, and\\nevaluate the performance of three GPT models: ChatGPT, GPT3.5\\n(text-davinci-003), and text-davinci-002. Our results show that GPT models\\nachieve very competitive translation quality for high resource languages, while\\nhaving limited capabilities for low resource languages. We also show that\\nhybrid approaches, which combine GPT models with other translation systems, can\\nfurther enhance the translation quality. We perform comprehensive analysis and\\nhuman evaluation to further understand the characteristics of GPT translations.\\nWe hope that our paper provides valuable insights for researchers and\\npractitioners in the field and helps to better understand the potential and\\nlimitations of GPT models for translation.\\n\\nTitle: A Study on the Performance of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)\\n  in Simulating Depressed Individuals on the Standardized Depressive Symptom\\n  Scale\\nSummary: Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with societal and economic\\nburden. Current diagnosis relies on self-reports and assessment scales, which\\nhave reliability issues. Objective approaches are needed for diagnosing\\ndepression. Objective: Evaluate the potential of GPT technology in diagnosing\\ndepression. Assess its ability to simulate individuals with depression and\\ninvestigate the influence of depression scales. Methods: Three\\ndepression-related assessment tools (HAMD-17, SDS, GDS-15) were used. Two\\nexperiments simulated GPT responses to normal individuals and individuals with\\ndepression. Compare GPT\\'s responses with expected results, assess its\\nunderstanding of depressive symptoms, and performance differences under\\ndifferent conditions. Results: GPT\\'s performance in depression assessment was\\nevaluated. It aligned with scoring criteria for both individuals with\\ndepression and normal individuals. Some performance differences were observed\\nbased on depression severity. GPT performed better on scales with higher\\nsensitivity. Conclusion: GPT accurately simulates individuals with depression\\nand normal individuals during depression-related assessments. Deviations occur\\nwhen simulating different degrees of depression, limiting understanding of mild\\nand moderate cases. GPT performs better on scales with higher sensitivity,\\nindicating potential for developing more effective depression scales. GPT has\\nimportant potential in depression assessment, supporting clinicians and\\npatients.\\n\\nTitle: Examining User-Friendly and Open-Sourced Large GPT Models: A Survey on\\n  Language, Multimodal, and Scientific GPT Models\\nSummary: Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have revolutionized the field\\nof natural language processing (NLP) with remarkable performance in various\\ntasks and also extend their power to multimodal domains. Despite their success,\\nlarge GPT models like GPT-4 face inherent limitations such as considerable\\nsize, high computational requirements, complex deployment processes, and closed\\ndevelopment loops. These constraints restrict their widespread adoption and\\nraise concerns regarding their responsible development and usage. The need for\\nuser-friendly, relatively small, and open-sourced alternative GPT models arises\\nfrom the desire to overcome these limitations while retaining high performance.\\nIn this survey paper, we provide an examination of alternative open-sourced\\nmodels of large GPTs, focusing on user-friendly and relatively small models\\nthat facilitate easier deployment and accessibility. Through this extensive\\nsurvey, we aim to equip researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a\\nthorough understanding of user-friendly and relatively small open-sourced\\nmodels of large GPTs, their current state, challenges, and future research\\ndirections, inspiring the development of more efficient, accessible, and\\nversatile GPT models that cater to the broader scientific community and advance\\nthe field of general artificial intelligence.

Process-in-memory (PIM)\\narchitectures can minimize off-chip data movement and utilize high internal\\nbandwidth. They stand out as promising candidates for accelerating\\nmemory-bounded tasks such as GPT inference.\\n  In this work, we propose a PIM accelerator, PIM-GPT, which achieves\\nend-to-end acceleration of GPT inference with high performance and high energy\\nefficiency. PIM-GPT leverages DRAM-based PIM designs for executing\\nmultiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in the DRAM chips, eliminating\\nthe need to move matrix data off-chip. Non-linear functions and data\\ncommunication is supported by an application specific integrated chip (ASIC).\\nAt the software level, mapping schemes are designed to maximize data locality\\nand computation parallelism by concatenating and partitioning matrices among\\nDRAM channels and banks to utilize all available in-memory computation units.\\nThe efficiency of the PIM-GPT architecture is verified through circuit\\nsynthesis and an event-driven clock-cycle accurate simulator. Overall, PIM-GPT\\nachieves 41$-$137$\\\\times$, 631$-$1074$\\\\times$ speedup and 123$-$383$\\\\times$,\\n320$-$602$\\\\times$ energy efficiency over GPU and CPU baseline on 8 GPT models\\nwith up to 1.4 billion parameters.\\n\\nTitle: Reconstruct Your Previous Conversations! Comprehensively Investigating\\n  Privacy Leakage Risks in Conversations with GPT Models\\nSummary: Significant advancements have recently been made in large language models\\nrepresented by GPT models. Users frequently have multi-round private\\nconversations with cloud-hosted GPT models for task optimization. Yet, this\\noperational paradigm introduces additional attack surfaces, particularly in\\ncustom GPTs and hijacked chat sessions. In this paper, we introduce a\\nstraightforward yet potent Conversation Reconstruction Attack. This attack\\ntargets the contents of previous conversations between GPT models and benign\\nusers, i.e., the benign users\\' input contents during their interaction with GPT\\nmodels. The adversary could induce GPT models to leak such contents by querying\\nthem with designed malicious prompts. Our comprehensive examination of privacy\\nrisks during the interactions with GPT models under this attack reveals GPT-4\\'s\\nconsiderable resilience. We present two advanced attacks targeting improved\\nreconstruction of past conversations, demonstrating significant privacy leakage\\nacross all models under these advanced techniques. Evaluating various defense\\nmechanisms, we find them ineffective against these attacks. Our findings\\nhighlight the ease with which privacy can be compromised in interactions with\\nGPT models, urging the community to safeguard against potential abuses of these\\nmodels\\' capabilities.\\n\\nTitle: A First Look at GPT Apps: Landscape and Vulnerability\\nSummary: Following OpenAI\\'s introduction of GPTs, a surge in GPT apps has led to the\\nlaunch of dedicated LLM app stores. Nevertheless, given its debut, there is a\\nlack of sufficient understanding of this new ecosystem. To fill this gap, this\\npaper presents a first comprehensive longitudinal (5-month) study of the\\nevolution, landscape, and vulnerability of the emerging LLM app ecosystem,\\nfocusing on two GPT app stores: \\\\textit{GPTStore.AI} and the official\\n\\\\textit{OpenAI GPT Store}. Specifically, we develop two automated tools and a\\nTriLevel configuration extraction strategy to efficiently gather metadata (\\\\ie\\nnames, creators, descriptions, \\\\etc) and user feedback for all GPT apps across\\nthese two stores, as well as configurations (\\\\ie system prompts, knowledge\\nfiles, and APIs) for the top 10,000 popular apps. Our extensive analysis\\nreveals: (1) the user enthusiasm for GPT apps consistently rises, whereas\\ncreator interest plateaus within three months of GPTs\\' launch; (2) nearly 90\\\\%\\nsystem prompts can be easily accessed due to widespread failure to secure GPT\\napp configurations, leading to considerable plagiarism and duplication among\\napps. Our findings highlight the necessity of enhancing the LLM app ecosystem\\nby the app stores, creators, and users.\\n\\nTitle: Assessing Large Language Models for Online Extremism Research:\\n  Identification, Explanation, and New Knowledge\\nSummary: The United States has experienced a significant increase in violent\\nextremism, prompting the need for automated tools to detect and limit the\\nspread of extremist ideology online. This study evaluates the performance of\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative\\nPre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in detecting and classifying online domestic\\nextremist posts. We collected social media posts containing \"far-right\" and\\n\"far-left\" ideological keywords and manually labeled them as extremist or\\nnon-extremist. Extremist posts were further classified into one or more of five\\ncontributing elements of extremism based on a working definitional framework.\\nThe BERT model\\'s performance was evaluated based on training data size and\\nknowledge transfer between categories. We also compared the performance of GPT\\n3.5 and GPT 4 models using different prompts: na\\\\\"ive, layperson-definition,\\nrole-playing, and professional-definition. Results showed that the best\\nperforming GPT models outperformed the best performing BERT models, with more\\ndetailed prompts generally yielding better results. However, overly complex\\nprompts may impair performance. Different versions of GPT have unique\\nsensitives to what they consider extremist. GPT 3.5 performed better at\\nclassifying far-left extremist posts, while GPT 4 performed better at\\nclassifying far-right extremist posts. Large language models, represented by\\nGPT models, hold significant potential for online extremism classification\\ntasks, surpassing traditional BERT models in a zero-shot setting. Future\\nresearch should explore human-computer interactions in optimizing GPT models\\nfor extremist detection and classification tasks to develop more efficient\\n(e.g., quicker, less effort) and effective (e.g., fewer errors or mistakes)\\nmethods for identifying extremist content.\\n\\nTitle: The application of GPT-4 in grading design university students\\'\\n  assignment and providing feedback: An exploratory study\\nSummary: This study aims to investigate whether GPT-4 can effectively grade\\nassignments for design university students and provide useful feedback. In\\ndesign education, assignments do not have a single correct answer and often\\ninvolve solving an open-ended design problem. This subjective nature of design\\nprojects often leads to grading problems,as grades can vary between different\\nraters,for instance instructor from engineering background or architecture\\nbackground. This study employs an iterative research approach in developing a\\nCustom GPT with the aim of achieving more reliable results and testing whether\\nit can provide design students with constructive feedback. The findings\\ninclude: First,through several rounds of iterations the inter-reliability\\nbetween GPT and human raters reached a level that is generally accepted by\\neducators. This indicates that by providing accurate prompts to GPT,and\\ncontinuously iterating to build a Custom GPT, it can be used to effectively\\ngrade students\\' design assignments, serving as a reliable complement to human\\nraters. Second, the intra-reliability of GPT\\'s scoring at different times is\\nbetween 0.65 and 0.78. This indicates that, with adequate instructions, a\\nCustom GPT gives consistent results which is a precondition for grading\\nstudents. As consistency and comparability are the two main rules to ensure the\\nreliability of educational assessment, this study has looked at whether a\\nCustom GPT can be developed that adheres to these two rules. We finish the\\npaper by testing whether Custom GPT can provide students with useful feedback\\nand reflecting on how educators can develop and iterate a Custom GPT to serve\\nas a complementary rater.\\n\\nTitle: SIEVE: General Purpose Data Filtering System Matching GPT-4o Accuracy at\\n  1% the Cost\\nSummary: Creating specialized large language models requires vast amounts of clean,\\nspecial purpose data for training and fine-tuning. With only a handful of\\nexisting large-scale, domain-specific datasets, creation of new datasets is\\nrequired in most applications. This requires the development of new\\napplication-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a\\nhigh-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective,\\nbut this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a\\nlightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost.\\nSIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o\\nfiltering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and\\nlightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background\\nwith a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as\\nGPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost. We experimentally validate SIEVE on the\\nOpenWebText dataset, using five highly customized filter tasks targeting high\\nquality and domain-specific content. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness\\nand efficiency of our method in curating large, high-quality datasets for\\nlanguage model training at a substantially lower cost (1%) than existing\\ntechniques. To further validate SIEVE, experiments show that SIEVE and GPT-4o\\nachieve similar accuracy, with human evaluators preferring SIEVE\\'s filtering\\nresults to those of GPT-4o.\\n\\nTitle: NERIF: GPT-4V for Automatic Scoring of Drawn Models\\nSummary: Scoring student-drawn models is time-consuming. Recently released GPT-4V\\nprovides a unique opportunity to advance scientific modeling practices by\\nleveraging the powerful image processing capability. To test this ability\\nspecifically for automatic scoring, we developed a method NERIF\\n(Notation-Enhanced Rubric Instruction for Few-shot Learning) employing\\ninstructional note and rubrics to prompt GPT-4V to score students\\' drawn models\\nfor science phenomena. We randomly selected a set of balanced data (N = 900)\\nthat includes student-drawn models for six modeling assessment tasks. Each\\nmodel received a score from GPT-4V ranging at three levels: \\'Beginning,\\'\\n\\'Developing,\\' or \\'Proficient\\' according to scoring rubrics. GPT-4V scores were\\ncompared with human experts\\' scores to calculate scoring accuracy. Results show\\nthat GPT-4V\\'s average scoring accuracy was mean =.51, SD = .037. Specifically,\\naverage scoring accuracy was .64 for the \\'Beginning\\' class, .62 for the\\n\\'Developing\\' class, and .26 for the \\'Proficient\\' class, indicating that more\\nproficient models are more challenging to score. Further qualitative study\\nreveals how GPT-4V retrieves information from image input, including problem\\ncontext, example evaluations provided by human coders, and students\\' drawing\\nmodels. We also uncovered how GPT-4V catches the characteristics of\\nstudent-drawn models and narrates them in natural language. At last, we\\ndemonstrated how GPT-4V assigns scores to student-drawn models according to the\\ngiven scoring rubric and instructional notes. Our findings suggest that the\\nNERIF is an effective approach for employing GPT-4V to score drawn models. Even\\nthough there is space for GPT-4V to improve scoring accuracy, some mis-assigned\\nscores seemed interpretable to experts. The results of this study show that\\nutilizing GPT-4V for automatic scoring of student-drawn models is promising.\\n\\nTitle: From Text to Image: Exploring GPT-4Vision\\'s Potential in Advanced\\n  Radiological Analysis across Subspecialties\\nSummary: The study evaluates and compares GPT-4 and GPT-4Vision for radiological\\ntasks, suggesting GPT-4Vision may recognize radiological features from images,\\nthereby enhancing its diagnostic potential over text-based descriptions.\\n\\nTitle: General probabilistic theories: An introduction\\nSummary: We introduce the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs for\\nshort). GPTs are a class of operational theories that generalize both\\nfinite-dimensional classical and quantum theory, but they also include other,\\nmore exotic theories, such as the boxworld theory containing Popescu-Rohrlich\\nboxes. We provide in-depth explanations of the basic concepts and elements of\\nthe framework of GPTs, and we also prove several well-known results. The review\\nis self-contained and it is meant to provide the reader with consistent\\nintroduction to GPTs. Our tools mainly include convex geometry, but we also\\nintroduce diagrammatic notation and we often express equations via diagrams.\\n\\nTitle: GPT, Ontology, and CAABAC: A Tripartite Personalized Access Control\\n  Model Anchored by Compliance, Context and Attribute\\nSummary: As digital healthcare evolves, the security of electronic health records\\n(EHR) becomes increasingly crucial. This study presents the GPT-Onto-CAABAC\\nframework, integrating Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), medical-legal\\nontologies and Context-Aware Attribute-Based Access Control (CAABAC) to enhance\\nEHR access security. Unlike traditional models, GPT-Onto-CAABAC dynamically\\ninterprets policies and adapts to changing healthcare and legal environments,\\noffering customized access control solutions. Through empirical evaluation,\\nthis framework is shown to be effective in improving EHR security by accurately\\naligning access decisions with complex regulatory and situational requirements.\\nThe findings suggest its broader applicability in sectors where access control\\nmust meet stringent compliance and adaptability standards.\\n\\nTitle: In-Context Learning for Long-Context Sentiment Analysis on\\n  Infrastructure Project Opinions\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various\\ntasks. However, they still struggle with long-context documents. This study\\nevaluates the performance of three leading LLMs: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and\\nGemini 1.5 Pro on lengthy, complex, and opinion-varying documents concerning\\ninfrastructure projects, under both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our\\nresults indicate that GPT-4o excels in zero-shot scenarios for simpler, shorter\\ndocuments, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet surpasses GPT-4o in handling more complex,\\nsentiment-fluctuating opinions. In few-shot scenarios, Claude 3.5 Sonnet\\noutperforms overall, while GPT-4o shows greater stability as the number of\\ndemonstrations increases.\\n\\nTitle: Are Transformers Truly Foundational for Robotics?\\nSummary: Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) are hyped to revolutionize\\nrobotics. Here we question their utility. GPTs for autonomous robotics demand\\nenormous and costly compute, excessive training times and (often) offboard\\nwireless control. We contrast GPT state of the art with how tiny insect brains\\nhave achieved robust autonomy with none of these constraints. We highlight\\nlessons that can be learned from biology to enhance the utility of GPTs in\\nrobotics.\\n\\nTitle: The Dawn of LMMs: Preliminary Explorations with GPT-4V(ision)\\nSummary: Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with\\nmulti-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic\\nintelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to\\ndeepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks\\nthat GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and\\ngenericity of GPT-4V\\'s capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes,\\nand the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring\\nGPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative\\nsamples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these\\nsamples demonstrate that GPT-4V\\'s unprecedented ability in processing\\narbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its\\ncapabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system.\\nFurthermore, GPT-4V\\'s unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn\\non input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as\\nvisual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on\\nthe emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for\\nGPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire\\nfuture research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to\\nexploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better\\nunderstanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the\\nmodel under our study is solely the product of OpenAI\\'s innovative work, and\\nthey should be fully credited for its development.

Whilst some have argued for the advantages of GPT\\n3.5 in enhancing academic writing, others have raised concerns such as\\nplagiarism, the spread of false information, and ecological issues. The need\\nfor finding ways to use GPT 3.5 models transparently has been voiced, and\\nsuggestions have been made on social media as to how to use GPT 3.5 models in a\\nsmart way. Nevertheless, to date, there is a lack of literature which clearly\\noutlines how to use GPT 3.5 models in academic writing, how effective they are,\\nand how to use them transparently. To address this, I conducted a personal\\nexperience experiment with GPT 3.5, specifically by using OpenAI text davinci\\n003 model, for writing this article. I identified five ways of using GPT 3.5:\\nChunk Stylist, Bullet to Paragraph, Talk Textualizer, Research Buddy, and\\nPolisher. I reflected on their efficacy, and commented on their potential\\nimpact on writing ethics. Additionally, I provided a comprehensive document\\nwhich shows the prompts I used, results I got from GPT 3.5, the final edits and\\nvisually compares those by showing the differences in percentages.\\n\\nTitle: Beyond Generating Code: Evaluating GPT on a Data Visualization Course\\nSummary: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the performance of the\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model in Harvard\\'s CS171 data\\nvisualization course. While previous studies have focused on GPT\\'s ability to\\ngenerate code for visualizations, this study goes beyond code generation to\\nevaluate GPT\\'s abilities in various visualization tasks, such as data\\ninterpretation, visualization design, visual data exploration, and insight\\ncommunication. The evaluation utilized GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to complete\\nassignments of CS171, and included a quantitative assessment based on the\\nestablished course rubrics, a qualitative analysis informed by the feedback of\\nthree experienced graders, and an exploratory study of GPT\\'s capabilities in\\ncompleting border visualization tasks. Findings show that GPT-4 scored 80% on\\nquizzes and homework, and TFs could distinguish between GPT- and\\nhuman-generated homework with 70% accuracy. The study also demonstrates GPT\\'s\\npotential in completing various visualization tasks, such as data cleanup,\\ninteraction with visualizations, and insight communication. The paper concludes\\nby discussing the strengths and limitations of GPT in data visualization,\\npotential avenues for incorporating GPT in broader visualization tasks, and the\\nneed to redesign visualization education.\\n\\nTitle: Towards Generic Anomaly Detection and Understanding: Large-scale\\n  Visual-linguistic Model (GPT-4V) Takes the Lead\\nSummary: Anomaly detection is a crucial task across different domains and data types.\\nHowever, existing anomaly detection models are often designed for specific\\ndomains and modalities. This study explores the use of GPT-4V(ision), a\\npowerful visual-linguistic model, to address anomaly detection tasks in a\\ngeneric manner. We investigate the application of GPT-4V in multi-modality,\\nmulti-domain anomaly detection tasks, including image, video, point cloud, and\\ntime series data, across multiple application areas, such as industrial,\\nmedical, logical, video, 3D anomaly detection, and localization tasks. To\\nenhance GPT-4V\\'s performance, we incorporate different kinds of additional cues\\nsuch as class information, human expertise, and reference images as\\nprompts.Based on our experiments, GPT-4V proves to be highly effective in\\ndetecting and explaining global and fine-grained semantic patterns in\\nzero/one-shot anomaly detection. This enables accurate differentiation between\\nnormal and abnormal instances. Although we conducted extensive evaluations in\\nthis study, there is still room for future evaluation to further exploit\\nGPT-4V\\'s generic anomaly detection capacity from different aspects. These\\ninclude exploring quantitative metrics, expanding evaluation benchmarks,\\nincorporating multi-round interactions, and incorporating human feedback loops.\\nNevertheless, GPT-4V exhibits promising performance in generic anomaly\\ndetection and understanding, thus opening up a new avenue for anomaly\\ndetection.\\n\\nTitle: Sim-GPT: Text Similarity via GPT Annotated Data\\nSummary: Due to the lack of a large collection of high-quality labeled sentence pairs\\nwith textual similarity scores, existing approaches for Semantic Textual\\nSimilarity (STS) mostly rely on unsupervised techniques or training signals\\nthat are only partially correlated with textual similarity, e.g., NLI-based\\ndatasets. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose the strategy of\\nmeasuring text similarity via GPT annotated data (Sim-GPT for short). The core\\nidea of Sim-GPT is to generate data with STS labels using GPT-4, based on which\\nan STS model is trained. Sim-GPT framework utilizes LLMs to provide a\\nsubstantial amount of reliable annotated data filling the gap of the lack of\\ntraining signals for STS. Sim-GPT is trained on a one-time generated dataset\\nusing BERT or RoBERTa as the backbone, which offers long-term savings in cost\\nand speed compared to repeatedly invoking LLMs for each sentence pair. Trained\\non the examples from GPT-4 (371K), Sim-GPT yields SOTA performances on the\\nwidely-used seven STS benchmarks: +0.99 over supervised-SimCSE, and +0.42 over\\nthe current SOTA PromCSE model. To encourage further advancements of the field,\\nwe release both models and the 371K annotated examples from GPT-4. Code, models\\nand annotated data are available at: https://github.com/ShuheWang1998/Sim-GPT.\\n\\nTitle: T2M-HiFiGPT: Generating High Quality Human Motion from Textual\\n  Descriptions with Residual Discrete Representations\\nSummary: In this study, we introduce T2M-HiFiGPT, a novel conditional generative\\nframework for synthesizing human motion from textual descriptions. This\\nframework is underpinned by a Residual Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\\n(RVQ-VAE) and a double-tier Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)\\narchitecture. We demonstrate that our CNN-based RVQ-VAE is capable of producing\\nhighly accurate 2D temporal-residual discrete motion representations. Our\\nproposed double-tier GPT structure comprises a temporal GPT and a residual GPT.\\nThe temporal GPT efficiently condenses information from previous frames and\\ntextual descriptions into a 1D context vector. This vector then serves as a\\ncontext prompt for the residual GPT, which generates the final residual\\ndiscrete indices. These indices are subsequently transformed back into motion\\ndata by the RVQ-VAE decoder. To mitigate the exposure bias issue, we employ\\nstraightforward code corruption techniques for RVQ and a conditional dropout\\nstrategy, resulting in enhanced synthesis performance. Remarkably, T2M-HiFiGPT\\nnot only simplifies the generative process but also surpasses existing methods\\nin both performance and parameter efficacy, including the latest\\ndiffusion-based and GPT-based models. On the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, our\\nframework achieves exceptional results across nearly all primary metrics. We\\nfurther validate the efficacy of our framework through comprehensive ablation\\nstudies on the HumanML3D dataset, examining the contribution of each component.\\nOur findings reveal that RVQ-VAE is more adept at capturing precise 3D human\\nmotion with comparable computational demand compared to its VQ-VAE\\ncounterparts. As a result, T2M-HiFiGPT enables the generation of human motion\\nwith significantly increased accuracy, outperforming recent state-of-the-art\\napproaches such as T2M-GPT and Att-T2M.\\n\\nTitle: Exploring Boundary of GPT-4V on Marine Analysis: A Preliminary Case\\n  Study\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a powerful ability to answer\\nvarious queries as a general-purpose assistant. The continuous multi-modal\\nlarge language models (MLLM) empower LLMs with the ability to perceive visual\\nsignals. The launch of GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) has\\ngenerated significant interest in the research communities. GPT-4V(ison) has\\ndemonstrated significant power in both academia and industry fields, as a focal\\npoint in a new artificial intelligence generation. Though significant success\\nwas achieved by GPT-4V, exploring MLLMs in domain-specific analysis (e.g.,\\nmarine analysis) that required domain-specific knowledge and expertise has\\ngained less attention. In this study, we carry out the preliminary and\\ncomprehensive case study of utilizing GPT-4V for marine analysis. This report\\nconducts a systematic evaluation of existing GPT-4V, assessing the performance\\nof GPT-4V on marine research and also setting a new standard for future\\ndevelopments in MLLMs. The experimental results of GPT-4V show that the\\nresponses generated by GPT-4V are still far away from satisfying the\\ndomain-specific requirements of the marine professions. All images and prompts\\nused in this study will be available at\\nhttps://github.com/hkust-vgd/Marine_GPT-4V_Eval\\n\\nTitle: GPTs Window Shopping: An analysis of the Landscape of Custom ChatGPT\\n  Models\\nSummary: OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT initiated a wave of technical iterations in the space of\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) by demonstrating the capability and disruptive\\npower of LLMs. OpenAI has prompted large organizations to respond with their\\nown advancements and models to push the LLM performance envelope. OpenAI has\\nprompted large organizations to respond with their own advancements and models\\nto push the LLM performance envelope. OpenAI\\'s success in spotlighting AI can\\nbe partially attributed to decreased barriers to entry, enabling any individual\\nwith an internet-enabled device to interact with LLMs. What was previously\\nrelegated to a few researchers and developers with necessary computing\\nresources is now available to all. A desire to customize LLMs to better\\naccommodate individual needs prompted OpenAI\\'s creation of the GPT Store, a\\ncentral platform where users can create and share custom GPT models.\\nCustomization comes in the form of prompt-tuning, analysis of reference\\nresources, browsing, and external API interactions, alongside a promise of\\nrevenue sharing for created custom GPTs. In this work, we peer into the window\\nof the GPT Store and measure its impact. Our analysis constitutes a large-scale\\noverview of the store exploring community perception, GPT details, and the GPT\\nauthors, in addition to a deep-dive into a 3rd party storefront indexing\\nuser-submitted GPTs, exploring if creators seek to monetize their creations in\\nthe absence of OpenAI\\'s revenue sharing.\\n\\nTitle: Voice Jailbreak Attacks Against GPT-4o\\nSummary: Recently, the concept of artificial assistants has evolved from science\\nfiction into real-world applications. GPT-4o, the newest multimodal large\\nlanguage model (MLLM) across audio, vision, and text, has further blurred the\\nline between fiction and reality by enabling more natural human-computer\\ninteractions. However, the advent of GPT-4o\\'s voice mode may also introduce a\\nnew attack surface. In this paper, we present the first systematic measurement\\nof jailbreak attacks against the voice mode of GPT-4o. We show that GPT-4o\\ndemonstrates good resistance to forbidden questions and text jailbreak prompts\\nwhen directly transferring them to voice mode. This resistance is primarily due\\nto GPT-4o\\'s internal safeguards and the difficulty of adapting text jailbreak\\nprompts to voice mode. Inspired by GPT-4o\\'s human-like behaviors, we propose\\nVoiceJailbreak, a novel voice jailbreak attack that humanizes GPT-4o and\\nattempts to persuade it through fictional storytelling (setting, character, and\\nplot). VoiceJailbreak is capable of generating simple, audible, yet effective\\njailbreak prompts, which significantly increases the average attack success\\nrate (ASR) from 0.033 to 0.778 in six forbidden scenarios. We also conduct\\nextensive experiments to explore the impacts of interaction steps, key elements\\nof fictional writing, and different languages on VoiceJailbreak\\'s effectiveness\\nand further enhance the attack performance with advanced fictional writing\\ntechniques. We hope our study can assist the research community in building\\nmore secure and well-regulated MLLMs.\\n\\nTitle: Analytical shape recovery of a conductivity inclusion based on Faber\\n  polynomials\\nSummary: A conductivity inclusion, inserted in a homogeneous background, induces a\\nperturbation in the background potential. This perturbation admits a multipole\\nexpansion whose coefficients are the so-called generalized polarization tensors\\n(GPTs). GPTs can be obtained from multistatic measurements. As a modification\\nof GPTs, the Faber polynomial polarization tensors (FPTs) were recently\\nintroduced in two dimensions. In this study, we design two novel analytical\\nnon-iterative methods for recovering the shape of a simply connected inclusion\\nfrom GPTs by employing the concept of FPTs. First, we derive an explicit\\nexpression for the coefficients of the exterior conformal mapping associated\\nwith an inclusion in a simple form in terms of GPTs, which allows us to\\naccurately reconstruct the shape of an inclusion with extreme or near-extreme\\nconductivity. Secondly, we provide an explicit asymptotic formula in terms of\\nGPTs for the shape of an inclusion with arbitrary conductivity by considering\\nthe inclusion as a perturbation of its equivalent ellipse. With this formula,\\none can non-iteratively approximate an inclusion of general shape with\\narbitrary conductivity, including a straight or asymmetric shape. Numerical\\nexperiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed analytical approaches.\\n\\nTitle: Adapting GPT, GPT-2 and BERT Language Models for Speech Recognition\\nSummary: Language models (LMs) pre-trained on massive amounts of text, in particular\\nbidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), generative\\npre-training (GPT), and GPT-2, have become a key technology for many natural\\nlanguage processing tasks. In this paper, we present results using fine-tuned\\nGPT, GPT-2, and their combination for automatic speech recognition (ASR).\\nUnlike unidirectional LM GPT and GPT-2, BERT is bidirectional whose direct\\nproduct of the output probabilities is no longer a valid language prior\\nprobability. A conversion method is proposed to compute the correct language\\nprior probability based on bidirectional LM outputs in a mathematically exact\\nway. Experimental results on the widely used AMI and Switchboard ASR tasks\\nshowed that the combination of the fine-tuned GPT and GPT-2 outperformed the\\ncombination of three neural LMs with different architectures trained from\\nscratch on the in-domain text by up to a 12% relative word error rate reduction\\n(WERR). Furthermore, on the AMI corpus, the proposed conversion for language\\nprior probabilities enables BERT to obtain an extra 3% relative WERR, and the\\ncombination of BERT, GPT and GPT-2 results in further improvements.\\n\\nTitle: The Emergence of Economic Rationality of GPT\\nSummary: As large language models (LLMs) like GPT become increasingly prevalent, it is\\nessential that we assess their capabilities beyond language processing. This\\npaper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make\\nbudgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences.\\nWe measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT\\'s decisions\\nwith utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that\\nGPT\\'s decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher\\nrationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in\\nthe literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are\\nslightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of\\nheterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the\\ndegree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender, but are\\nsensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations.\\nThese results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need\\nto further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying\\nmechanisms.\\n\\nTitle: Event Stream GPT: A Data Pre-processing and Modeling Library for\\n  Generative, Pre-trained Transformers over Continuous-time Sequences of\\n  Complex Events\\nSummary: Generative, pre-trained transformers (GPTs, a.k.a. \"Foundation Models\") have\\nreshaped natural language processing (NLP) through their versatility in diverse\\ndownstream tasks. However, their potential extends far beyond NLP. This paper\\nprovides a software utility to help realize this potential, extending the\\napplicability of GPTs to continuous-time sequences of complex events with\\ninternal dependencies, such as medical record datasets. Despite their\\npotential, the adoption of foundation models in these domains has been hampered\\nby the lack of suitable tools for model construction and evaluation. To bridge\\nthis gap, we introduce Event Stream GPT (ESGPT), an open-source library\\ndesigned to streamline the end-to-end process for building GPTs for\\ncontinuous-time event sequences. ESGPT allows users to (1) build flexible,\\nfoundation-model scale input datasets by specifying only a minimal\\nconfiguration file, (2) leverage a Hugging Face compatible modeling API for\\nGPTs over this modality that incorporates intra-event causal dependency\\nstructures and autoregressive generation capabilities, and (3) evaluate models\\nvia standardized processes that can assess few and even zero-shot performance\\nof pre-trained models on user-specified fine-tuning tasks.\\n\\nTitle: MTD-GPT: A Multi-Task Decision-Making GPT Model for Autonomous Driving\\n  at Unsignalized Intersections\\nSummary: Autonomous driving technology is poised to transform transportation systems.\\nHowever, achieving safe and accurate multi-task decision-making in complex\\nscenarios, such as unsignalized intersections, remains a challenge for\\nautonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel approach to this issue with\\nthe development of a Multi-Task Decision-Making Generative Pre-trained\\nTransformer (MTD-GPT) model. Leveraging the inherent strengths of reinforcement\\nlearning (RL) and the sophisticated sequence modeling capabilities of the\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), the MTD-GPT model is designed to\\nsimultaneously manage multiple driving tasks, such as left turns,\\nstraight-ahead driving, and right turns at unsignalized intersections. We\\ninitially train a single-task RL expert model, sample expert data in the\\nenvironment, and subsequently utilize a mixed multi-task dataset for offline\\nGPT training. This approach abstracts the multi-task decision-making problem in\\nautonomous driving as a sequence modeling task. The MTD-GPT model is trained\\nand evaluated across several decision-making tasks, demonstrating performance\\nthat is either superior or comparable to that of state-of-the-art single-task\\ndecision-making models.\\n\\nTitle: GPT-in-the-Loop: Adaptive Decision-Making for Multiagent Systems\\nSummary: This paper introduces the \"GPT-in-the-loop\" approach, a novel method\\ncombining the advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nlike Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) with multiagent (MAS) systems.\\nVenturing beyond traditional adaptive approaches that generally require long\\ntraining processes, our framework employs GPT-4 for enhanced problem-solving\\nand explanation skills. Our experimental backdrop is the smart streetlight\\nInternet of Things (IoT) application. Here, agents use sensors, actuators, and\\nneural networks to create an energy-efficient lighting system. By integrating\\nGPT-4, these agents achieve superior decision-making and adaptability without\\nthe need for extensive training. We compare this approach with both traditional\\nneuroevolutionary methods and solutions provided by software engineers,\\nunderlining the potential of GPT-driven multiagent systems in IoT.\\nStructurally, the paper outlines the incorporation of GPT into the agent-driven\\nFramework for the Internet of Things (FIoT), introduces our proposed\\nGPT-in-the-loop approach, presents comparative results in the IoT context, and\\nconcludes with insights and future directions.\\n\\nTitle: GPT-Lab: Next Generation Of Optimal Chemistry Discovery By GPT Driven\\n  Robotic Lab\\nSummary: The integration of robots in chemical experiments has enhanced experimental\\nefficiency, but lacking the human intelligence to comprehend literature, they\\nseldom provide assistance in experimental design. Therefore, achieving\\nfull-process autonomy from experiment design to validation in self-driven\\nlaboratories (SDL) remains a challenge. The introduction of Generative\\nPre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly GPT-4, into robotic\\nexperimentation offers a solution. We introduce GPT-Lab, a paradigm that\\nemploys GPT models to give robots human-like intelligence. With our robotic\\nexperimentation platform, GPT-Lab mines literature for materials and methods\\nand validates findings through high-throughput synthesis. As a demonstration,\\nGPT-Lab analyzed 500 articles, identified 18 potential reagents, and\\nsuccessfully produced an accurate humidity colorimetric sensor with a root mean\\nsquare error (RMSE) of 2.68%. This showcases the rapid materials discovery and\\nvalidation potential of our system.\\n\\nTitle: Can GPT models Follow Human Summarization Guidelines? Evaluating ChatGPT\\n  and GPT-4 for Dialogue Summarization\\nSummary: This study explores the capabilities of prompt-driven Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in adhering to human guidelines for dialogue\\nsummarization. Experiments employed DialogSum (English social conversations)\\nand DECODA (French call center interactions), testing various prompts:\\nincluding prompts from existing literature and those from human summarization\\nguidelines, as well as a two-step prompt approach. Our findings indicate that\\nGPT models often produce lengthy summaries and deviate from human summarization\\nguidelines. However, using human guidelines as an intermediate step shows\\npromise, outperforming direct word-length constraint prompts in some cases. The\\nresults reveal that GPT models exhibit unique stylistic tendencies in their\\nsummaries. While BERTScores did not dramatically decrease for GPT outputs\\nsuggesting semantic similarity to human references and specialised pre-trained\\nmodels, ROUGE scores reveal grammatical and lexical disparities between\\nGPT-generated and human-written summaries. These findings shed light on the\\ncapabilities and limitations of GPT models in following human instructions for\\ndialogue summarization.\\n\\n', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'Now that we have collected the summaries of papers related to GPT models, the next step is to analyze these abstracts to identify application domains.
